text\<open>In this theory we consider properties of functions that are binary 
  operations, that is they map $X\times X$ into $X$.\<close>

subsection\<open>Lifting operations to a function space\<close>

text\<open>It happens quite often that we have a binary operation on some set and
  we need a similar operation that is defined for functions on that set. 
  For example once we know how to add real numbers we also know how to add
  real-valued functions: for $f,g:X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ we define
  $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$. Note that formally the $+$ means something 
  different on the left hand side of this equality than on the 
  right hand side.
  This section aims at formalizing this process.
  We will call it "lifting to a function space", if you have a 
  suggestion for a better name, please let me know.\<close>
 
text\<open>Since we are writing in generic set notation, 
  the definition below is a bit complicated. Here it what it says:
  Given a set $X$ and another set $f$ (that represents a binary function on $X$) 
  we are defining $f$ lifted to function space over $X$
  as the binary function (a set of pairs) on the space 
  $F = X \rightarrow \textrm{range}(f)$ such that the value of this function
  on pair $\langle a,b \rangle$ of functions on $X$ is another function $c$ on $X$
  with values defined by $c(x) = f\langle a(x), b(x)\rangle$.

subsection\<open>Associative and commutative operations\<close>

text\<open>In this section we define associative and commutative operations 
  and prove that they remain such when we lift them
  to a function space.\<close>

text\<open>Typically we say that a binary operation "$\cdot $" 
  on a set $G$ is ''associative''
  if $(x\cdot y)\cdot z = x\cdot (y\cdot z)$ for all $x,y,z \in G$.
  Our actual definition below does not use the multiplicative notation
  so that we can apply it equally to the additive notation $+$ 
  or whatever infix symbol we may want to use. 
  Instead, we use the generic set theory notation
  and write $P\langle x,y \rangle$ to denote the value of the operation
  $P$ on a pair $\langle x,y \rangle \in G\times G$.\<close>

definition 
  IsAssociative (infix "{is associative on}" 65) where
  "P {is associative on} G \<equiv> P : G\<times>G\<rightarrow>G \<and> 
  (\<forall> x \<in> G. \<forall> y \<in> G. \<forall> z \<in> G. 
  ( P`(\<langle>P`(\<langle>x,y\<rangle>),z\<rangle>) = P`( \<langle>x,P`(\<langle>y,z\<rangle>)\<rangle> )))"

text\<open>A binary function $f: X\times X \rightarrow Y$ is commutative
  if $f\langle x,y \rangle = f\langle y,x \rangle$. Note that
  in the definition of associativity above we talk about binary
  ''operation'' and here we say use the term binary ''function''. 
  This is not set in stone, but usually the word "operation" is used 
  when the range is a factor of the domain, while the word "function"
  allows the range to be a completely unrelated set.\<close>

  IsCommutative (infix "{is commutative on}" 65) where

subsection\<open>Lifting to subsets\<close>

text\<open>Suppose we have a binary operation $f : X \times X \rightarrow X$
  written additively as $f\langle x,y\rangle = x + y$. Such operation
  naturally defines another binary operation on the subsets of $X$
  that satisfies $A+B = \{ x+y : x \in A, y\in B\}$. This new operation 
  which we will call "$f$ lifted to subsets" inherits many properties
  of $f$, such as associativity, commutativity and existence of the 
  neutral element. This notion is useful for considering interval arithmetics.
\<close>

text\<open>The next definition describes the notion of a binary operation
  lifted to subsets. It is written in a way that might be a bit unexpected,
  but really it is the same as the intuitive definition, but shorter.
  In the definition we take a pair $p \in Pow(X)\times Pow(X)$, say
  $p = \langle A, B\rangle $, where $A,B \subseteq X$. 
  Then we assign this pair of sets the set 
  $\{f\langle x,y \rangle : x\in A, y\in B \} = \{ f(x'): x' \in A\times B\}$
  The set on the right hand side is the same as the image
  of $A\times B$ under $f$. In the definition we don't use $A$ and $B$ symbols,
  but write \<open>fst(p)\<close> and \<open>snd(p)\<close>, resp. Recall that in Isabelle/ZF
  \<open>fst(p)\<close> and  \<open>snd(p)\<close> denote the first and second components
  of an ordered pair $p$.
  See the lemma \<open>lift_subsets_explained\<close> for a more intuitive
  notation.\<close>
