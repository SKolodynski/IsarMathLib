theory Real_ZF imports Int_ZF_IML Ring_ZF_1

begin

text\<open>The goal of the \<open>Real_ZF\<close> series of theory files is 
  to provide a contruction of the set of 
  real numbers. There are several ways to construct real numbers. 
  Most common start from the rational numbers and use Dedekind cuts 
  or Cauchy sequences. \<open>Real_ZF_x.thy\<close> series formalizes 
  an alternative 
  approach that constructs real numbers directly from the group of integers.
  Our formalization is mostly based on \cite{Arthan2004}. 
  Different variants of this contruction are also 
  described in \cite{Campo2003} and \cite{Street2003}.
  I recommend to read these papers, but for the impatient here is a short 
  description: we take a set of maps $s : Z\rightarrow Z$ such that
   the set $\{s(m+n)-s(m)-s(n)\}_{n,m \in Z}$ is finite 
  ($Z$ means the integers here). We call these maps slopes. 
  Slopes form a group with the natural addition
  $(s+r)(n) = s(n)+r(n)$. The maps such that the set $s(Z)$ is finite 
  (finite range functions) form a subgroup of slopes. 
  The additive group of real numbers is defined as the 
  quotient group of slopes by the (sub)group of finite range functions.
  The multiplication is defined as the projection of the composition of slopes
  into the resulting quotient (coset) space.

subsection\<open>The definition of real numbers\<close>

text\<open>This section contains the construction of the ring of real numbers
  as classes of slopes - integer almost homomorphisms. The real definitions
  are in \<open>Group_ZF_2\<close> theory, here we just specialize the definitions
  of almost homomorphisms, their equivalence and operations to the 
  additive group of integers from the general case of abelian groups considered
  in \<open>Group_ZF_2\<close>.\<close>

text\<open>The set of slopes is defined as the set of almost homomorphisms
  on the additive group of integers.\<close>

definition
  "Slopes \<equiv> AlmostHoms(int,IntegerAddition)"

text\<open>The first operation on slopes (pointwise addition) is a special case 
  of the first operation on almost homomorphisms.\<close>

definition
  "SlopeOp1 \<equiv> AlHomOp1(int,IntegerAddition)"

text\<open>The second operation on slopes (composition) is a special case 
  of the second operation on almost homomorphisms.\<close>

definition
  "SlopeOp2 \<equiv> AlHomOp2(int,IntegerAddition)"

text\<open>Bounded integer maps are functions from integers
  to integers that have finite range. They play a role of 
  zero in the set of real numbers we are constructing.\<close>

definition
  "BoundedIntMaps \<equiv> FinRangeFunctions(int,int)"

text\<open>Bounded integer maps form a normal subgroup of slopes.
  The equivalence relation on slopes is the (group) quotient 
  relation defined by this subgroup.
\<close>

definition
  "SlopeEquivalenceRel \<equiv> QuotientGroupRel(Slopes,SlopeOp1,BoundedIntMaps)"

text\<open>The set of real numbers is the set of equivalence classes of
  slopes.\<close>

definition
  "RealNumbers \<equiv> Slopes//SlopeEquivalenceRel"

text\<open>The addition on real numbers is defined as the projection of 
  pointwise addition of slopes on the quotient. This means that
  the additive group of real numbers is the quotient group: 
  the group of slopes (with pointwise addition) defined by the
  normal subgroup of bounded integer maps.\<close>

definition
  "RealAddition \<equiv> ProjFun2(Slopes,SlopeEquivalenceRel,SlopeOp1)"

text\<open>Multiplication is defined as the projection of composition
  of slopes on the quotient. The fact that it works is probably the
  most surprising part of the construction.\<close>

text\<open>We first show that we can use theorems proven in some proof contexts
