subsection\<open>Induced relations and order isomorphisms\<close>

text\<open>When we have two sets $X,Y$, function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and
  a relation $R$ on $Y$ we can define a relation $r$ on $X$
  by saying that $x\ r\ y$ if and only if $f(x) \ R \ f(y)$. 
  This is especially interesting when $f$ is a bijection as all reasonable
  properties of $R$ are inherited by $r$. This section treats mostly the case
  when $R$ is an order relation and $f$ is a bijection.
  The standard Isabelle's \<open>Order\<close> theory 
  defines the notion of a space of order isomorphisms
  between two sets relative to a relation. We expand that material
  proving that order isomrphisms preserve interesting properties
  of the relation.\<close>
