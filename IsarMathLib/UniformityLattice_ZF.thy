begin

text\<open>In this theory we consider the collection of all uniformities on a arbitrary set $X$.
  Since unformities are sets of subsets of $X\times X$ such set of uniformities 
  is naturally ordered by the inclusion relation.
  Specifically, for two uniformities $\mathcal{U}_1$ and $\mathcal{U}_2$â€‹ on a set $X$ 
  if $\mathcal{U}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{U}_2$ we say that $\mathcal{U}_2$ is finer than 
  $\mathcal{U}_1$ or that $\mathcal{U}_1$ is coarser than $\mathcal{U}_2$. 
  In this theory we show that with this order the collection of uniformities 
  forms a complete lattice. \<close>

subsection\<open>Least upper bound of a set of uniformities\<close>

text\<open>In this section we show that inclusion order on the collection of unformities on a fixed
  set is (Dedekind) complete i.e. every nonempty set of uniformities has
  a least upper bound. \<close>


text\<open>Given a set of uniformities $\mathcal{U}$ on $X$ we define a collection of subsets of $X$ 
  called \<open>LUB_UnifBase\<close> (the least upper bound base in comments) 
  as the set of all products of nonempty finite subsets of $\bigcup\mathcal{U}$. 
  The "least upper bound base" term is not justified at this point, but we will show later 
  that this set is actually a uniform base (i.e. a fundamental system of entourages) 
  on $X$ and hence the supersets of it form a uniformity on $X$, which is the supremum 
  (i.e. the least upper bound) of $\mathcal{U}$.\<close>

subsection\<open>Greatest lower bound of a set of uniformities\<close>

text\<open>In this this section we show that every set of uniformities on a fixed set $X$
  has a greatest lower bound, i.e. an infimum.
  The approach taken in the previous section to show the existence of the least upper bound 
  of a collection of uniformities does not work for the greatest lower bound. 
  The collection defined as the set of all products of nonempty finite subsets 
  of $\bigcap\mathcal{U}$ in general is not a fundamental system of entourages. Even though the 
  first three conditions hold for such collection, the fourth one does not. 
  The approach that works is to show the the supremum of the collection of lower bounds
  is a lower bound, hence the maximum of the set of lower bounds. 
  We present this approach below in theorem \<open>unif_inf_alt\<close>. The simplest approach though is
  to use the general property of partially ordered sets shown in lemma \<open>bounded_below_sups_infs\<close> 
  in the \<open>Order_ZF_1a\<close> theory: if all nonempty subsets of such set have suprema and the whole set
  has a minimum then all nonempty subsets have infima.\<close>

text\<open>To shorten the proofs we introduce the concept of the supremum of the set
  of lower bounds of some collection of uniformities $\mathcal{U}$. 
  We know from the previous section that such supremum exists. 
  Later in this section we show that this supremum is itself a lower bound of $\mathcal{U}$, 
  so it's the greatest lower bound i.e. infimum of $\mathcal{U}$. \<close>

text\<open>The rest of the propositions in this section presents an alternative, more explicit approach 
  to proving the existence of infimum of a set of uniformities that does not use 
  theorem \<open>bounded_below_sups_infs\<close> from the \<open>Order_ZF_1a\<close> theory. 
  It's here mostly as a curiosity, since I have formalised this approach first and I did not 
  want to remove it as it may be of some interest to somebody. 
  The next lemma shows that the set of lower bounds of a nonempty set of uniformities is nonempty.\<close>

lemma lb_nempty_nempty: assumes "X\<noteq>\<emptyset>" "\<U>\<subseteq>Uniformities(X)" "\<U>\<noteq>\<emptyset>"
  shows "{\<Psi>\<in>Uniformities(X). \<Psi>\<subseteq>\<Inter>\<U>} \<noteq> \<emptyset>"
proof -
  from assms have "{X\<times>X} \<in> Uniformities(X)" and "(X\<times>X) \<in> \<Inter>\<U>"
