begin

text\<open> This theory defines uniform spaces and proves their basic properties. \<close>

subsection\<open> Definition and motivation \<close>

text\<open> Just like a topological space constitutes the minimal setting 
  in which one can speak of continuous functions, the notion of uniform spaces 
  (commonly attributed to Andr√© Weil) captures the minimal setting in which one can speak 
  of uniformly continuous functions. 
  In some sense this is a generalization of the notion of metric (or metrizable) 
  spaces and topological groups. \<close>

text\<open> There are several definitions of uniform spaces. 
  The fact that these definitions are equivalent is far from obvious
  (some people call such phenomenon cryptomorphism). 
  We will use the definition of the uniform structure (or ''uniformity'') 
  based on entourages. This was the original definition by Weil and it seems 
  to be the most commonly used.
  A uniformity consists of entourages that are binary relations between points of space $X$ 
  that satisfy a certain collection of conditions, specified below. \<close>

definition
  IsUniformity ("_ {is a uniformity on} _" 90) where
    "\<Phi> {is a uniformity on} X \<equiv>(\<Phi> {is a filter on} (X\<times>X))
    \<and> (\<forall>U\<in>\<Phi>. id(X) \<subseteq> U \<and> (\<exists>V\<in>\<Phi>. V O V \<subseteq> U) \<and> converse(U) \<in> \<Phi>)"

text\<open>A Member of a uniformity on $X$ is a reflexive relation on $X$.\<close>

  shows "A \<subseteq> X\<times>X" and "id(X) \<subseteq> A" 
  using assms IsUniformity_def IsFilter_def by auto

text\<open>The definition of uniformity states (among other things) that for every member $U$
  of uniformity $\Phi$ there is another one, say $V$ such that $V\circ V\subseteq U$. Sometimes such $V$
  is said to be half the size of $U$. The next lemma states that $V$ can be taken to be symmetric. \<close>

lemma half_size_symm: assumes "\<Phi> {is a uniformity on} X" "U\<in>\<Phi>" 
  shows "\<exists>W\<in>\<Phi>. W O W \<subseteq> U \<and> W=converse(W)"

text\<open> If $\Phi$ is a uniformity on $X$, then the every element $V$ of $\Phi$ is a certain relation 
  on $X$ (a subset of $X\times X$) and is called 
  an ''entourage''. For an $x\in X$ we call $V\{ x\}$ a neighborhood of $x$. 
  The first useful fact we will show is that neighborhoods are non-empty. \<close>

lemma neigh_not_empty: 
  assumes "\<Phi> {is a uniformity on} X" "V\<in>\<Phi>" and "x\<in>X"
  shows "V``{x} \<noteq> 0" and "x \<in> V``{x}"

text\<open> Uniformity \<open>\<Phi>\<close>  defines a natural topology on its space $X$ via the neighborhood system 
  that assigns the collection $\{V(\{x\}):V\in \Phi\}$ to every point $x\in X$. 
  In the next lemma we show that if we define a function
  this way the values of that function are what they should be. This is only a technical
  fact which is useful to shorten the remaining proofs, usually treated as obvious in standard
  mathematics. \<close>

  assumes "\<Phi> {is a uniformity on} X"
  defines "\<M> \<equiv> {\<langle>x,{V``{x}.V\<in>\<Phi>}\<rangle>.x\<in>X}"

text\<open> When we have a uniformity $\Phi$ on $X$ we can define a topology on $X$ in a (relatively)
  natural way. We will call that topology the \<open> UniformTopology(\<Phi>)\<close>. The definition may be a bit 
  cryptic but it just combines the construction of a neighborhood system from uniformity as in 
  the assumptions of lemma \<open>filter_from_uniformity\<close> and the construction of topology from 
  a neighborhood system from theorem \<open>topology_from_neighs\<close>. 
  We could probably reformulate the definition to skip 
  the $X$ parameter because if $\Phi$ is a uniformity on $X$ then $X$ can be recovered 
  from (is determined by) $\Phi$. \<close>
