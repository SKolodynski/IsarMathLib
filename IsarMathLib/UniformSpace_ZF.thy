text\<open> This theory defines uniform spaces and proves their basic properties. \<close>

subsection\<open> Entourages and neighborhoods \<close>

text\<open> Just like a topological space constitutes the minimal setting 
  in which one can speak of continuous functions, the notion of uniform spaces 
  (commonly attributed to Andr√© Weil) captures the minimal setting in which one can speak 
  of uniformly continuous functions. 
  In some sense this is a generalization of the notion of metric (or metrizable) 
  spaces and topological groups. \<close>

text\<open> There are several definitions of uniform spaces. 
  The fact that these definitions are equivalent is far from obvious
  (some people call such phenomenon cryptomorphism). 
  We will use the definition of the uniform structure (or ''uniformity'') 
  based on entourages. This was the original definition by Weil and it seems 
  to be the most commonly used.
  A uniformity consists of entourages that are binary relations between points of space $X$ 
  that satisfy a certain collection of conditions, specified below. \<close>

text\<open> If $\Phi$ is a uniformity on $X$, then the every element $V$ of $\Phi$

text\<open>Analogous to the predicate "satisfies base condition" (defined in \<open>Topology_ZF_1\<close>)

  for a collection $\mathfrak{B}$ of subsets of $X\times X$ to be a base of some
  uniformity on $X$. Namely, the following conditions are necessary and sufficient:

  1. Intersection of two sets of $\mathfrak{B}$ contains a set of $\mathfrak{B}$.

  2. Every set of $\mathfrak{B}$ contains the diagonal of $X\times X$.

  3. For each set $B_1\in \mathfrak{B}$ we can find a set $B_2\in \mathfrak{B}$ 
  such that $B_2\subseteq B_1^{-1}$.

  4. For each set $B_1\in \mathfrak{B}$ we can find a set $B_2\in \mathfrak{B}$
  such that $B_2\circ B_2 \subseteq B_1$.

subsection\<open>Least upper bound of a set of uniformities\<close>

text\<open>Uniformities on a set $X$ are naturally ordered by the inclusion relation.
  Specifically, for two uniformities $\mathcal{U}_1$ and $\mathcal{U}_2$‚Äã on a set $X$

  $\mathcal{U}_1$ or that $\mathcal{U}_1$ is coarser than $\mathcal{U}_2$. 
  Turns out this order is complete: every nonempty set of uniformities has
