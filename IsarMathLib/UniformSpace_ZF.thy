text\<open> This theory defines uniform spaces and proves their basic properties. \<close>

subsection\<open> Definition and motivation \<close>

text\<open> Just like a topological space constitutes the minimal setting 
  in which one can speak of continuous functions, the notion of uniform spaces 
  (commonly attributed to Andr√© Weil) captures the minimal setting in which one can speak 
  of uniformly continuous functions. 
  In some sense this is a generalization of the notion of metric (or metrizable) 
  spaces and topological groups. \<close>

text\<open> There are several definitions of uniform spaces. 
  The fact that these definitions are equivalent is far from obvious
  (some people call such phenomenon cryptomorphism). 
  We will use the definition of the uniform structure (or ''uniformity'') 
  based on entourages. This was the original definition by Weil and it seems 
  to be the most commonly used.
  A uniformity consists of entourages that are binary relations between points of space $X$ 
  that satisfy a certain collection of conditions, specified below. \<close>

    "\<Phi> {is a uniformity on} X \<equiv>(\<Phi> {is a filter on} (X\<times>X))
    \<and> (\<forall>U\<in>\<Phi>. id(X) \<subseteq> U \<and> (\<exists>V\<in>\<Phi>. V O V \<subseteq> U) \<and> converse(U) \<in> \<Phi>)"

text\<open> If $\Phi$ is a uniformity on $X$, then the every element $V$ of $\Phi$ 
  is a certain relation on $X$ (a subset of $X\times X$) and is called 
  an ''entourage''. For an $x\in X$ we call $V\{ x\}$ a neighborhood of $x$. 
  The first useful fact we will show is that neighborhoods are non-empty. \<close>

text\<open>The definition of uniformity states (among other things) that for every member $U$

  is said to be half the size of $U$. The next lemma states that $V$ can be taken to be symmetric. \<close>

text\<open>If $\Phi$ is a uniformity on $X$ that generates a topology $T$, $R$ is any relation
  on $X$ (i.e. $R\subseteq X\times X$), $W$ is a symmetric entourage (i.e. $W\in \Phi$,
  and $W$ is symmetric (i.e. equal to its converse)), then the closure of $R$ in the product topology
  is contained the the composition $V\circ (M \circ V)$.
