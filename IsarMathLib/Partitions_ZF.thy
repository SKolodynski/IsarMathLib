begin

text\<open>It is a common trick in proofs that we divide a set into non-overlapping
  subsets. The first case is when we split the set into 
  two nonempty disjoint sets. Here this is modeled as an ordered pair of sets
  and the set of such divisions of set $X$ is called \<open>Bisections(X)\<close>.
  The second variation on this theme is a set-valued function (aren't they all
  in ZF?) whose values are nonempty and mutually disjoint.

subsection\<open>Bisections\<close>

text\<open>This section is about dividing sets into two non-overlapping subsets.
\<close>

text\<open>The set of bisections of a given set $A$ is a set of pairs of nonempty
  subsets of $A$ that do not overlap and their union is equal to $A$.\<close>

subsection\<open>Partitions\<close>

text\<open>This sections covers the situation when we have an arbitrary number
  of sets we want to partition into.\<close>

text\<open>We define a notion of a partition as a set valued function 
  such that the values for different arguments are disjoint.
  The name is derived from the fact that such 
  function "partitions" the union of its arguments. 
  Please let me know if you have 
  a better idea for a name for such notion. We would prefer to say
 ''is a partition'', but that reserves the letter ''a'' as a keyword(?)
  which causes problems.\<close>

definition
  Partition ("_ {is partition}" [90] 91) where
  "P {is partition} \<equiv>  \<forall>x \<in> domain(P). 
  P`(x) \<noteq> 0 \<and> (\<forall>y \<in> domain(P). x\<noteq>y \<longrightarrow> P`(x) \<inter> P`(y) = 0)"

  A2: "a : succ(n) \<rightarrow> X"   "a {is partition}"
  shows "(\<Union>i\<in>n. a`(i)) \<inter> a`(n) = 0"
proof -
  { assume "(\<Union>i\<in>n. a`(i)) \<inter> a`(n) \<noteq> 0"
    then have "\<exists>x. x \<in> (\<Union>i\<in>n. a`(i)) \<inter> a`(n)"

    then obtain x where "x \<in> (\<Union>i\<in>n. a`(i))" and  I: "x \<in> a`(n)"

text\<open>We can turn every injection into a partition.\<close>

lemma inj_partition:
