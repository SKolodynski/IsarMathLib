a genaralization of the natural numbers, used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets.

subsection\<open>Some new ideas on cardinals\<close>

text\<open>All the results of this section are done without assuming
the Axiom of Choice. With the Axiom of Choice in play, the proofs become easier
and some of the assumptions may be dropped.

Since General Topology Theory is closely related to Set Theory, it is very interesting
to make use of all the possibilities of Set Theory to try to classify homeomorphic
topological spaces. These ideas are generally used to prove that two topological
spaces are not homeomorphic.\<close>

text\<open>There exist cardinals which are the successor of another cardinal,
but; as happens with ordinals, there are cardinals which are limit cardinal.\<close>

subsection\<open>Main result on cardinals (without the Axiom of Choice)\<close>

text\<open>If two sets are strictly injective to an infinite cardinal,
then so is its union. For the case of successor cardinal, this
theorem is done in the isabelle library in a more general setting;
 but that theorem is of not
use in the case where \<open>LimitC(Q)\<close> and it also makes use
of the Axiom of Choice. The mentioned theorem is in the
theory file \<open>Cardinal_AC.thy\<close>\<close>

text\<open>Note that if $Q$ is finite and different from $1$, let's assume $Q=n$,
then the union of $A$ and $B$ is not bounded by $Q$.
Counterexample: two disjoint sets of $n-1$ elements each
have a union of $2n-2$ elements which are more than $n$.

Note also that if $Q=1$ then $A$ and $B$ must be empty
and the union is then empty too; and $Q$ cannot be \<open>0\<close> because
no set is injective and not bijective to \<open>0\<close>.

The proof is divided in two parts, first the case when
both sets $A$ and $B$ are finite; and second,
the part when at least one of them is infinite.
In the first part, it is used the fact that a finite
union of finite sets is finite. In the second part it
is used the linear order on cardinals (ordinals).
This proof can not be generalized to a setting with 
an infinite union easily.\<close>
