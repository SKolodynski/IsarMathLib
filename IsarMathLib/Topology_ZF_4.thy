subsection\<open>Nets\<close>

text\<open>Nets are a generalization of sequences. It is known that sequences do not
determine the behavior of the topological spaces that are not first countable; i.e.,
have a countable neighborhood base for each point. To solve this problem,
nets were defined so that the behavior of any topological space can be
thought in terms of convergence of nets.\<close>

text\<open>We say that a relation $r$ \<open>directs\<close> a set $X$ if the relation is reflexive, transitive
  on $X$ and for every two elements $x,y$ of $X$ there is some element $z$ such that both
  $x$ and $y$ are in the relation with $z$. Note that this naming is a bit inconsistent with what
  is defined in \<open>Order_ZF\<close> where we define what it means that $r$ \<open>up-directs\<close> $X$ 
  (the third condition in the definition below) or $r$ \<open>down-directs\<close> $X$. This naming inconsistency
   will be fixed in the future (maybe).\<close>

text\<open>The previous result states that, when considering convergence, the filters
do not generalize nets. When considering a filter, there is always a net that
converges to the same points of the original filter.

Now we see that with nets, results come naturally applying the axiom
of choice; but with filters, the results come, may be less natural, but
with no choice. The reason is that \<open>Net(\<FF>)\<close> is a net
that doesn't come into our attention as a first choice; maybe because
we restrict ourselves to the anti-symmetry property of orders without realizing that
a directed set is not an order.

The following results will state that filters are not just a subclass of nets,
but that nets and filters are equivalent on convergence: for every filter there is a net
converging to the same points, and also, for every net there is a filter converging
to the same points.\<close>

text\<open>We know now that filters and nets are the same thing, when working convergence
of topological spaces. Sometimes, the nature of filters makes it easier to generalized
them as follows.

Instead of considering all subsets of some set $X$, we can consider only open sets (we
get an open filter) or closed sets (we get a closed filter). There are many more
useful examples that characterize topological properties.

This type of generalization cannot be done with nets.

Also a filter can give us a topology in the following way:\<close>
