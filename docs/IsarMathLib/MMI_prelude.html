  proven in the ZFC set theory. This theory is part of an attempt to translate
  those theorems to Isar so that they are available for Isabelle/ZF users.
  A total of about 1200 assertions have been translated, 600 of that 
  with proofs (the rest was proven automatically by Isabelle). 
  The translation was done with the support of the mmisar tool, whose source
  is included in the IsarMathLib distributions prior to version 1.6.4. 
  The translation tool was doing about 99 percent of work involved, with the rest
  mostly related to the difference between Isabelle/ZF and Metamath 
  metalogics. Metamath uses Tarski-Megill metalogic that does not have a notion
  of bound variables (see 
  </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span> http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta/Distinctors_vs_binders ›</span></span></span><span>
  for details and discussion).
  The translation project is closed now as I decided that it was too boring 
  and tedious even with the support of mmisar software. Also, the translated
  proofs are not as readable as native Isar proofs which goes against IsarMathLib
  philosophy.›</span></span></span><span>

</span><span class="keyword1"><span class="command"><span>subsection</span></span></span><span class="quoted"><span class="plain_text"><span>‹Importing from Metamath - how is it done›</span></span></span><span>

</span><span class="keyword1"><span class="command"><span>text</span></span></span><span class="quoted"><span class="plain_text"><span>‹
  We are interested in importing the theorems about complex numbers
  that start from the "recnt" theorem on. This is done mostly automatically
  by the mmisar tool that is included in the IsarMathLib distributions prior
  to version 1.6.4.
  The tool works as follows:

  First it reads the list of (Metamath) names of theorems 
  that are already imported to IsarMathlib ("known theorems") 
  and the list of theorems that are intended to be imported in this 
  session ("new theorems"). 
  The new theorems are consecutive theorems about complex numbers
  as they appear in the Metamath database.
  Then mmisar creates a "Metamath script" that contains 
  Metamath commands that open a log file and put the statements
  and proofs of the new theorems in that file in a readable format. 
  The tool writes this script to a disk file and executes metamath 
  with standard input redirected from that file. Then the log file is read
  and its contents converted to the Isar format. In Metamath, 
  the proofs of theorems about complex numbers 
  depend only on 28 axioms of complex numbers and some basic logic and 
  set theory theorems.
  The tool finds which of these dependencies are not known yet and repeats 
  the process of getting their statements from Metamath as with the 
  new theorems. As a result of this process mmisar creates files 
  new\_theorems.thy, new\_deps.thy and new\_known\_theorems.txt.
  The file new\_theorems.thy contains the theorems (with proofs) 
  imported from Metamath in this session. These theorems are added
  (by hand) to the current </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>MMI_Complex_ZF_x.thy›</span></span></span><span> file. 
  The file new\_deps.thy contains the 
  statements of new dependencies with generic proofs "by auto".
  These are added to the </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>MMI_logic_and_sets.thy›</span></span></span><span>.
  Most of the dependencies can be proven automatically by Isabelle.
  However, some manual work has to be done for the dependencies
  that Isabelle can not prove by itself and to correct problems related
  to the fact that Metamath uses a metalogic based on 
  distinct variable constraints (Tarski-Megill metalogic), 
  rather than an explicit notion of free and bound variables.

  The old list of known theorems is replaced by the new list and
  mmisar is ready to convert the next batch of new theorems.
  Of course this rarely works in practice without tweaking the mmisar
  source files every time a new batch is processed.›</span></span></span><span>

</span><span class="keyword1"><span class="command"><span>text</span></span></span><span class="quoted"><span class="plain_text"><span>‹The next locale sets up the context to which Metamath theorems
  about complex numbers are imported. It assumes the axioms
  of complex numbers and defines the notation used for complex numbers.
  
  One of the problems with importing theorems from Metamath is that
  Metamath allows direct infix notation for binary operations so 
  that the notation $a f b$ is allowed where $f$ is a function 
  (that is, a set of pairs). To my knowledge, 
  Isar allows only notation </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>f`⟨a,b⟩›</span></span></span><span> with a possibility of 
  defining a syntax say </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>a \&lt;ca&gt; b›</span></span></span><span> to mean the same as </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>f`⟨a,b⟩›</span></span></span><span> 
  (please correct me if I am wrong here). This is why we have
  two objects for addition: one called </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>caddset›</span></span></span><span> that represents
  the binary function, and the second one called </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>ca›</span></span></span><span> which 
  defines the </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>a \&lt;ca&gt; b›</span></span></span><span> notation for </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>caddset`⟨a,b⟩›</span></span></span><span>.
  The same applies to multiplication of real numbers.
  
  Another difficulty is that Metamath allows to define sets with syntax
  $\{ x | p\}$ where $p$ is some formula that (usually) depends on $x$.
  Isabelle allows the set comprehension like this only as a subset of another 
  set i.e. $\{x\in A . p(x)\}$. This forces us to have a sligtly different 
  definition of (complex) natural numbers, requiring explicitly that natural 
  numbers is a subset of reals. Because of that, the proofs of Metamath theorems 
  that reference the definition directly can not be imported.
