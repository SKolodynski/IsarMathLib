</span><span class="keyword1"><span class="command"><span>text</span></span></span><span class="quoted"><span class="plain_text"><span>‹</span><span>Metamath's set.mm features a large (over 8000) collection of theorems 
</span><span>  proven in the ZFC set theory. This theory is part of an attempt to translate
</span><span>  those theorems to Isar so that they are available for Isabelle/ZF users.
</span><span>  A total of about 1200 assertions have been translated, 600 of that 
</span><span>  with proofs (the rest was proven automatically by Isabelle). 
</span><span>  The translation was done with the support of the mmisar tool, whose source
</span><span>  is included in the IsarMathLib distributions prior to version 1.6.4. 
</span><span>  The translation tool was doing about 99 percent of work involved, with the rest
</span><span>  mostly related to the difference between Isabelle/ZF and Metamath 
</span><span>  metalogics. Metamath uses Tarski-Megill metalogic that does not have a notion
</span><span>  of bound variables (see 
</span><span>  </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span> http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta/Distinctors_vs_binders ›</span></span></span><span>
</span><span>  for details and discussion).
</span><span>  The translation project is closed now as I decided that it was too boring 
</span><span>  and tedious even with the support of mmisar software. Also, the translated
</span><span>  proofs are not as readable as native Isar proofs which goes against IsarMathLib
</span><span>  philosophy.</span><span>›</span></span></span><span>

</span><span class="keyword1"><span class="command"><span>subsection</span></span></span><span class="quoted"><span class="plain_text"><span>‹</span><span>Importing from Metamath - how is it done</span><span>›</span></span></span><span>

</span><span class="keyword1"><span class="command"><span>text</span></span></span><span class="quoted"><span class="plain_text"><span>‹</span><span>
  </span><span>We are interested in importing the theorems about complex numbers
</span><span>  that start from the "recnt" theorem on. This is done mostly automatically
</span><span>  by the mmisar tool that is included in the IsarMathLib distributions prior
</span><span>  to version 1.6.4.
</span><span>  The tool works as follows:
</span><span>
</span><span>  First it reads the list of (Metamath) names of theorems 
</span><span>  that are already imported to IsarMathlib ("known theorems") 
</span><span>  and the list of theorems that are intended to be imported in this 
</span><span>  session ("new theorems"). 
</span><span>  The new theorems are consecutive theorems about complex numbers
</span><span>  as they appear in the Metamath database.
</span><span>  Then mmisar creates a "Metamath script" that contains 
</span><span>  Metamath commands that open a log file and put the statements
</span><span>  and proofs of the new theorems in that file in a readable format. 
</span><span>  The tool writes this script to a disk file and executes metamath 
</span><span>  with standard input redirected from that file. Then the log file is read
</span><span>  and its contents converted to the Isar format. In Metamath, 
</span><span>  the proofs of theorems about complex numbers 
</span><span>  depend only on 28 axioms of complex numbers and some basic logic and 
</span><span>  set theory theorems.
</span><span>  The tool finds which of these dependencies are not known yet and repeats 
</span><span>  the process of getting their statements from Metamath as with the 
</span><span>  new theorems. As a result of this process mmisar creates files 
</span><span>  new\_theorems.thy, new\_deps.thy and new\_known\_theorems.txt.
</span><span>  The file new\_theorems.thy contains the theorems (with proofs) 
</span><span>  imported from Metamath in this session. These theorems are added
</span><span>  (by hand) to the current </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>MMI_Complex_ZF_x.thy›</span></span></span><span> file. 
</span><span>  The file new\_deps.thy contains the 
</span><span>  statements of new dependencies with generic proofs "by auto".
</span><span>  These are added to the </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>MMI_logic_and_sets.thy›</span></span></span><span>.
</span><span>  Most of the dependencies can be proven automatically by Isabelle.
</span><span>  However, some manual work has to be done for the dependencies
</span><span>  that Isabelle can not prove by itself and to correct problems related
</span><span>  to the fact that Metamath uses a metalogic based on 
</span><span>  distinct variable constraints (Tarski-Megill metalogic), 
</span><span>  rather than an explicit notion of free and bound variables.
</span><span>
</span><span>  The old list of known theorems is replaced by the new list and
</span><span>  mmisar is ready to convert the next batch of new theorems.
</span><span>  Of course this rarely works in practice without tweaking the mmisar
</span><span>  source files every time a new batch is processed.</span><span>›</span></span></span><span>

</span><span class="keyword1"><span class="command"><span>text</span></span></span><span class="quoted"><span class="plain_text"><span>‹</span><span>The next locale sets up the context to which Metamath theorems
</span><span>  about complex numbers are imported. It assumes the axioms
</span><span>  of complex numbers and defines the notation used for complex numbers.
</span><span>  
</span><span>  One of the problems with importing theorems from Metamath is that
</span><span>  Metamath allows direct infix notation for binary operations so 
</span><span>  that the notation $a f b$ is allowed where $f$ is a function 
</span><span>  (that is, a set of pairs). To my knowledge, 
</span><span>  Isar allows only notation </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>f`⟨a,b⟩›</span></span></span><span> with a possibility of 
</span><span>  defining a syntax say </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>a \&lt;ca&gt; b›</span></span></span><span> to mean the same as </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>f`⟨a,b⟩›</span></span></span><span> 
</span><span>  (please correct me if I am wrong here). This is why we have
</span><span>  two objects for addition: one called </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>caddset›</span></span></span><span> that represents
</span><span>  the binary function, and the second one called </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>ca›</span></span></span><span> which 
</span><span>  defines the </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>a \&lt;ca&gt; b›</span></span></span><span> notation for </span><span class="antiquoted"><span class="raw_text"><span class="operator"><span>‹</span></span><span>caddset`⟨a,b⟩›</span></span></span><span>.
</span><span>  The same applies to multiplication of real numbers.
</span><span>  
</span><span>  Another difficulty is that Metamath allows to define sets with syntax
</span><span>  $\{ x | p\}$ where $p$ is some formula that (usually) depends on $x$.
</span><span>  Isabelle allows the set comprehension like this only as a subset of another 
</span><span>  set i.e. $\{x\in A . p(x)\}$. This forces us to have a sligtly different 
</span><span>  definition of (complex) natural numbers, requiring explicitly that natural 
</span><span>  numbers is a subset of reals. Because of that, the proofs of Metamath theorems 
</span><span>  that reference the definition directly can not be imported.</span><span>
